# SalmonFalls
Combines continuous hydrologic and GPS observations from the Salmon Falls Landslide and produces correlations using splined-fit models.
Written in MATLAB and dependent on Curve-fitting Toolbox for Spline-fitting, although simpler adaptations are in progress

Produces time-series of landslide movement at 8 continuous GPS stations, networked to correct for minor errors such as tectonic drift, atmpspheric loading, etc. 
Prodices time-series of groundwater depth, hyrdopgraphs of surficial water, and precipitations records for comparison to GPS movement
Compares GPS derived 3D landslide displacement and correlates movement to commensurate changes in hydrologic conditions
